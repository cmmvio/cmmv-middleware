## Description

The ``@cmmv/middleware`` module is designed to integrate Express middlewares into CMMV applications. It is based on the original implementation of Express and the features offered by the [senchalabs/connect](https://github.com/senchalabs/connect) project. This module allows for flexible and modular addition of middlewares, providing a similar experience to Express. It supports a wide range of common middlewares, including authentication, session handling, request body parsing, and more, making it easy to create routes and handle HTTP requests efficiently and in an organized manner. Furthermore, the module maintains compatibility with custom middlewares, enabling developers to extend and adapt its functionality according to their application's specific needs.

## Installation

Install the ``@cmmv/middleware`` package via npm:

```bash
$ pnpm add @cmmv/middleware
```

## Quick Start

Below is a simple example of how to create a new CMMV application:

```typescript
import cmmv from '@cmmv/server';
import * as cors from 'cors';
import * as compression from 'compression';
import helmet from 'helmet';
import _ from "./index";

const app = cmmv();

app.use(_(cors()));
app.use(_(helmet()));
app.use(_(compression({ level: 6, threshold: 0 })));

app.get("/", (req, res) => {
    res.json({Hello: "World"});
});

app.listen({ host: "127.0.0.1", port: 3000})
.then(server => {
    console.log(
        `Listen on http://${server.address().address}:${server.address().port}`,
    );
})
.catch(err => {
    throw Error(err.message);
});;
```

### Native CMMV Middleware

CMMV provides native implementations for several common middlewares with enhanced performance optimizations. These native implementations are prefixed with `@cmmv/` and include:

- `@cmmv/body-parser` ([NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@cmmv/body-parser))
- `@cmmv/compression` ([NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@cmmv/compression))
- `@cmmv/cookie-parser` ([NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@cmmv/cookie-parser))
- `@cmmv/cors` ([NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@cmmv/cors))
- `@cmmv/etag` ([NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@cmmv/etag))
- `@cmmv/helmet` ([NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@cmmv/helmet))
- `@cmmv/server-static` ([NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@cmmv/server-static))

### Summary

- **Working**: `cors`, `helmet`, `body-parser`, and `morgan` have been tested and work as expected.
- **Not Working**: `compression`, `cookie-session`, and `express-session` have issues related to header management, session handling, or storage that need to be addressed.
- **Not Tested**: `serve-static`, `serve-favicon`, `method-override`, and `multer` have not been tested yet.
- **Deprecated**: `csurf` is deprecated and will not be tested.
